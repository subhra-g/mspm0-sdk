## Example Summary

This code example demonstrates how to use the ECDSA verify function
over the NIST curve P-256 to verify a signature.

This example uses SHA-256 for the message pre-hash.

The NIST CAVP ECDSA verify test case ID #x is used here
to demonstate the sign computation.  The routine is expected
to return a VALID status.  To test the INVALID signature case, change
any part of the message and re-run the example to confirm that INVALID is
reported.

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.  Set break points at the trap loops at the end of main() to verify correct execution.
