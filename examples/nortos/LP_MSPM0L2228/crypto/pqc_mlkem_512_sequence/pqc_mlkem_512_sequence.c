 *  @brief      PQC module ML-KEM-512 sequence example
 * 
 *  This code example demonstrates how to use the ML-KEM-512 key encapsulation
 *  mechanism to perform a key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation 
 *  sequence.
 * 
 *  The entropy source (TRNG) is used to seed a DRBG which is subsequently used
 *  to generate the random seed values for ML-KEM-512.  From the seed values, 
 *  ML-KEM-512 encapsulation and decapsulation keys are first generated.  
 *  Then, the encapsulation key is used with additional random seed data to 
 *  generate a ciphertext and shared secret.  Finally, the
 *  decapsulation function is used with the decapsulation key to take the 
 *  ciphertext and generate the same shared secret.
 * 
 *  In the end, the shared secret values are expected to match for the
 *  example to pass.
 * 
 *  This example combines encapsulation and decapsulation into a single code 
 *  example to show the sequence. In a real world application, ML-KEM-512 
 *  would be used by two processors/systems to agree to a shared secret over 
 *  an unsecure channel, where on side performs encapsulation and the other 
 *  side performs decapsulation, and the ciphertext is shared across the 
 *  unsecure channel.
