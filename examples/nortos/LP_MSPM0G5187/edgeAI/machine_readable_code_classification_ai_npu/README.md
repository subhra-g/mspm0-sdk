# Machine-Readable Code Classification Example

## Example Summary

This example demonstrates **machine-readable code classification** using an AI model on the **MSPM0G5187 microcontroller** with hardware-accelerated inference using the **TinyEngine™ NPU**.

The application classifies an input image into one of three machine-readable code categories:

- Barcode
- Other code
- QR code

The classification result is indicated using the onboard RGB LEDs.

The class-to-LED mapping is:

- **Red**: Barcode
- **Green**: Other code
- **Blue**: QR code

In this example, the input image is provided as a pre-loaded test vector. The image is normalized, passed to the compiled AI model, and the predicted class is shown through the onboard LED.

## AI Model Information

| Property           | Value                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Model Task         | Machine-readable code classification |
| Input Type         | Image / pre-processed image tensor   |
| Output Classes     | 3                                    |
| Class 0            | Barcode                              |
| Class 1            | Other code                           |
| Class 2            | QR code                              |
| Input Layout       | `NCHW`                               |
| Quantization       | INT8 / compiler-generated runtime    |
| Inference Target   | TinyEngine™ NPU on MSPM0G5187        |

The model takes a grayscale input image, normalizes it, and classifies it into one of three categories: **Barcode**, **Other code**, or **QR code**.

## Input Preprocessing

The input image is normalized before inference by first converting each pixel from the 0–255 range to 0–1.
The normalized pixel is then centered around mean 0.5 and scaled by 0.5, producing values roughly in the [-1, 1] range.
This preprocessed tensor is stored in NCHW format and passed as the input feature map to the TVM-generated model.

In the PyTorch training framework, neural networks are trained with optimizations (for example, aggressive quantization) that target TI MCUs. After training, the neural networks are compiled by the [TI Neural Network Compiler](https://software-dl.ti.com/mctools/nnc/mcu/users_guide/index.html). Options passed to the compiler determine which of the following actions the generated inference library performs:
1. Hardware accelerated inference using TinyEngine™ NPU.
2. Software-only inference using the CPU on the MCU.

This example is built for the hardware-accelerated inference mode using the TinyEngine™ NPU on MSPM0G5187.

The output from the TI Neural Network Compiler is an artifacts directory that will contain: A header file (for example, tvmgen_default.h), and a library file (for example, model.a). This makes the output from the compiler easier to integrate with the project.

## AI Performance

| Metric                   | Value     |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Accuracy (R square)      | ~99.9     |
| Flash Usage(KB)          | 28.4      |
| RAM Usage(KB)            | 10.2      |

*Note: Performance metrics measured on MSPM0G5187 at 80 MHz with TinyEngine™ NPU acceleration.*

### Device Migration Recommendations

This project was developed for a superset device included in the MSPM0 LaunchPad. Please visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration) for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

**Note**: This example requires an NPU-enabled device (MSPM0G5187). Migration to non-NPU devices will require using the CPU-only version of this example.

### Low-Power Recommendations

TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G5187 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau967).

## Hardware Requirements

1. LP-MSPM0G5187 LaunchPad

## Example Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Connect the LP-MSPM0G5187 LaunchPad to your PC via USB.
   - Ensure the LED jumpers (J11, J12, J13) are populated to enable LED indication.

2. **Operation**
   - On startup, the application initializes the peripherals and powers up the NPU.
   - The NPU interrupt is enabled and the system waits for inference completion.
   - The pre-loaded test vector containing actuator sensor data is fed to the AI model.
   - The model performs hardware-accelerated inference using the TinyEngine™ NPU.
   - Once inference is complete, the NPU is powered down to save energy.
   - The LED corresponding to the detected class is turned on:
     - **Red**: Barcode
     - **Green**: Other
     - **Blue**: QR Code

3. **Running the Example**
   - Compile, load, and run the application on your MSPM0 device.
   - Observe the LED indication for the classification result.
   - To test different input data, modify the test vector in `machine_readable_code_classification_testvector.h`.

## Software Details

- **AI Inference**: Runs a pre-trained 5-layer CNN model using TVM runtime with NPU acceleration.
- **NPU Management**: The application handles NPU power-up, interrupt configuration, and power-down.
- **LED Indication**: Classification result is indicated by toggling onboard LEDs with 4 different color combinations.
- **AI Model**: Model details are available on [Model Zoo](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/tinyml-tensorlab/tree/r1.3/tinyml-modelzoo)

## Notes

- This example uses a pre-loaded test vector for demonstration. For real-world applications, integrate with position and current sensors.
- The model is optimized for NPU deployment with aggressive quantization.
- The NPU is powered down after inference to minimize power consumption.
