## Example Summary

This example demonstrates the live preview feature for AC arc fault detection on CCStudio™ Edge AI Studio using MSPM0 devices. The application captures AC current waveforms using an ADC, extracts relevant features using the feature_extract library, and performs inference using a neural network model to classify the waveform as either normal operation or containing an arc fault signature. The final output is then streamed to CCStudio™ Edge AI Studio for real-time visualization.

This example is built for hardware accelerated inference using TinyEngine™ NPU.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the MSPM0 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G5187 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau967).

## Hardware Requirements

1. LP-MSPM0G5187 LaunchPad
2. TIDA-010971 Board

## Example Usage
1. Connect a current sensor to the ADC input pin PB22. The sensor should be capable of safely measuring AC current in the circuit being monitored.
2. Compile, load and run the example.
3. Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
   - Baud rate: 5820000
   - Data bits: 8
   - Stop bits: 1
   - Parity: None
   - Flow control: None

During operation:
- GPIO PA31 is set to low state during normal operation.
- GPIO PA31 is set to high state when an arc fault is detected.
- Detection results are also output via UART for monitoring and debugging

Note: This example has been trained and validated with typical household AC circuits (120V/60Hz and 230V/50Hz). For optimal performance in different electrical environments, the model may need to be retrained with application-specific data.
