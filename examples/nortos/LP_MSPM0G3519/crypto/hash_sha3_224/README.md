## Example Summary

This code example demonstrates how to use the one-shot SHA3-224 function
to compute the SHA3-224 hash of a message.

The NIST CAVP short message test vector (Len = 128 bits = 16 bytes) is used
to demonstrate the hash computation. The hash routine is expected
to return a success status and the actual (computed) hash is expected
to match the expected (stored) hash value.

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Set break points at the trap loops at the end of main() to verify correct execution.
