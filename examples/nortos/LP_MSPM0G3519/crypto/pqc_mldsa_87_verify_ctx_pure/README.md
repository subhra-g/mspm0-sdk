## Example Summary

This code example demonstrates how to use the ML-DSA-87 verify
function to verify a signature with a ML-DSA-87 public key using the
pure verify mode (message passed directly to the verify function) with
a context string.

The NIST CAVP FIPS 204 ML-DSA verify test case ID #63 is used here
to demonstate the sign computation.  The routine is expected
to return a VALID status.  To test the INVALID signature case, change
any part of the message and re-run the example to confirm that INVALID is
reported.

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.  Set break points at the trap loops at the end of main() to verify correct execution.
